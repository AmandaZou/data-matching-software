# Data Matching software

This is a list of (Fuzzy) Data Matching software. 

The term data matching is used to indicate the procedure of bringing together information from two or more records that are believed to belong to the same entity. Data matching has two applications: (1) to match data across multiple datasets and (2) to match data within a dataset. See the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage) about data matching for more information. 

*Similar terms:* record linkage, data matching, deduplication, fuzzy matching, entity resolution

## Free

- [Dedupe](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe) - Dedupe is a python library that uses machine learning to perform fuzzy matching, deduplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data. `MIT` `Python`
- [FERBL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/febrl/) - Data standardisation (segmentation and cleaning) and probabilistic record linkage ("fuzzy" matching) of one or more files or data sources which do not share a unique record key or identifier. `Python`
- [FRIL](http://fril.sourceforge.net/) - FRIL is FREE open source tool that enables fast and easy record linkage. The tool extends traditional record linkage tools with a richer set of parameters. `Java`
- [FuzzyMatcher](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fuzzymatcher) - A Python package that allows the user to fuzzy match two pandas dataframes based on one or more fields in common. The functionality is limited at the moment. `MIT` `Python`
- [Python Record Linkage Toolkit](https://github.com/J535D165/recordlinkage) - The Python Record Linkage Toolkit is a library to link records in or between data sources.

- [Dedupe.io (by DataMade)](https://dedupe.io/) - Commercial implementation of Dedupe. Dedupe.io matches records in the cloud and provides a browser-based GUI for contructing training data. 

## Outdated/ no longer available

- BigMatch (by USA census) - A record linkage tool for use in matching a very large file against a moderate size file developed by the USA Census Bureau. There are several papers available about this program [(BigMatch, 2007)](https://www.census.gov/srd/papers/pdf/rrc2007-01.pdf)
